# Java_RMI
Assignment 2 for NET4005 @ Carleton University
Author(s): William Vail 

Objective:
Objective of this assignment is to write a simple client-server network application using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
or the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system.

You will write a simple air-ticket reservation system, using RPC/RMI mechanism. The reservation server (rsvserver)
maintains the seat availability information and responds to client requests for reservation or availability. For simplicity,
we are concerned about one flight on one date only. The reservation information will be maintained only in memory, no
need to maintain a persistent database.
